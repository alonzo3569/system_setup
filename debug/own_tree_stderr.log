  By not providing "FindMOOS.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "MOOS", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "MOOS" (requested

  Add the installation prefix of "MOOS" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "MOOS_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "MOOS"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
